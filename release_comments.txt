This file should be updated with the release notes for the platform. If there is both an appliance and
hosted build of this package and each environment has different release notes, then instead of using
this file create these two files:

release_comments.hosted.txt
release_comments.appliance.txt

and provide the platform-specific release notes in each. Release notes should cover:

- High-level overview of what the release is providing
- Migrations that should be run after release
