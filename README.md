This package is provided as an example for common elements that need to appear in a base package.
Packages can be forked from this project as a starter package to be altered with tickets as part
of a standard release cycle for the first version.

All pacakages require a RPM specification that is used to build deploy packages of the software.
For information on how to build RPM spec files, see:

http://docs.sys1.vip.inn.mwn.leeent.net/display/DEV/Packaging+Software

Package building and deployment is handled through the Pacman build system which can be accessed
here:

http://cvs1.sys1.sys.inn.mwn.leeent.net/pacman-ui/

Packages can also be built on the command-line for testing on build servers. For instructions, see:
